# Transport Enquiry System Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for the **Transport Enquiry System**, a Java-based project designed to handle transport-related queries and operations efficiently.

---

## Features

- **Java Backend**: Built entirely in Java, leveraging its robust and platform-independent capabilities.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase for easier navigation and scalability.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing transport-related data and queries.
- **Database Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with relational databases for data persistence.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend application with RESTful services.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build.
- **MySQL (or similar)**: For database management (to be configured).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
2. Apache Maven.
3. MySQL or another relational database system.
4. An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/archxit/transport-enquiry-system-backend.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd transport-enquiry-system-backend
```

3. Build the project using Maven:
```
mvn clean install
```

4. Configure the database connection in application.properties (or equivalent):
   - Update database URL, username, and password as per your setup.

5. Run the application:
